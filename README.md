## Description

Welcome to your own personal speakeasy!

[Visit the site!](personalspeakeasy.surge.sh)

This basic web app allows you to search through cocktails for inspiration and create your own. It's perfect for creating shareable cocktail menus for parties or training material for restaurants.

## Specs and Styling

This site was created with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React. 

It has five components and pulls information from a personally created mock API and a third party cocktail database.

### Vector Images 

I created the logo using the mockup application, **Sketch**.

In order to maintain a 1920s feel, I chose to divide the sections with an art deco divider. I also chose a muted color scheme with a pop of gold to mimic the architectural elements of 1920s bars. 

### Typography 

The two font families used are **Sail** and **Baskerville**.

**Sail** was selected for it's playful, 1920s feel and is paired with the more formal serif **Baskerville** for text boxes and descriptions.

## Next Steps

I pushed myself to make a functional search bar that displays multiple results and in the next phase I'd like to save the recipes from those results into the favorites list. 

I will also be making the favorites section more customizable by implementing edit and delete options to the cocktail recipes.
