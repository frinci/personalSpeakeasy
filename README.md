## Description

Welcome to your own personal speakeasy. 

This basic web app allows you to search through cocktails for inspiration and create your own. It's perfect for creating shareable cocktail menus for parties or training material for restaurants.

## Specs and Styling

This site was created with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and React. 

It has five components and pulls information from a personally created mock API and a third party cocktail database.

### Vector Images 

I created the logo using the mockup application, **Sketch**.

In order to maintain a 1920s feel, I chose to divide the sections with an art deco divider. I also chose a muted color scheme with a pop of gold to mimic the architectural elements of 1920s bars. 

### Typography 

The two font families used are **Sail** and **Baskerville**.

**Sail** was selected for it's playful, 1920s feel and is paired with the more formal serif **Baskerville** for text boxes and descriptions.

## Next Steps

I pushed myself to make a functional search bar that displays multiple results and in the next phase I'd like to save the recipes from those results into the favorites list. 

I will also be making the favorites section more customizable by implementing edit and delete options to the cocktail recipes.
